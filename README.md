<h1>Welcome to the Arabic Virtual Keyboard and Transliteration Web App</h1>
    <p>This web app provides a convenient way to write in Arabic, whether you are familiar with the Arabic script or not. It offers two primary features:</p>
    <h2>1. Virtual Arabic Keyboard</h2>
    <p>Our virtual Arabic keyboard allows you to type in Arabic characters using an on-screen keyboard. Simply click on the Arabic letters and characters to input them into your text field. This feature is incredibly useful for those who may not have access to a physical Arabic keyboard or are not familiar with Arabic script.</p>

  <h2>2. Transliteration</h2>
    <p>We understand that not everyone is fluent in Arabic script. That's why our app includes a transliteration feature. When you type in Roman characters (English letters), our app will automatically transliterate them into Arabic script. This makes it easy for users to write in Arabic, even if they don't know the Arabic alphabet.</p>

 <h2>What's New</h2>
<p>It's well-known that there are countless websites with similar features. After extensively using virtual keyboards, I decided to create my own with some quality improvements that I believe are essential in these web apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added the ability to input numbers without transliterating them into letters. This feature works by conditioning the non-transliteration of numbers outside of words.</li>
  <li>Fixed the janky cursor behavior in the input textarea. Now, the cursor will remain in the same position where the user placed it initially, which is particularly helpful for handling long texts.</li>
  <li>Enhanced the overall appearance and user experience using the Bootstrap library. We've also selected a clear and readable font with an appropriate size, and made adjustments to the textarea height for a more comfortable writing experience.</li>
</ul>
